								Java is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers. Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.

							<p style="margin-bottom: 35px;">Kotlin is a statically typed programming language that runs on the Java virtual machine and also can be compiled to JavaScript source code or use the LLVM compiler infrastructure. Its primary development is from a team of JetBrains programmers based in Saint Petersburg, Russia. While the syntax is not compatible with Java, Kotlin is designed to interoperate with Java code and is reliant on Java code from the existing Java Class Library, such as the collections framework. Kotlin uses aggressive type inference to determine the type of values and expressions for which type has been left unstated. This reduces language verbosity relative to Java, which demands often entirely redundant type specifications prior to version 10. As of Android Studio 3.0 (October 2017) Kotlin is a fully supported programming language by Google on the Android Operating System, and is directly included in the Android Studio 3.0 IDE package as an alternative to the standard Java compiler</p>

						<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px;">Syntax:</h2>
						<p style="margin-top: 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.7;">The syntax of Java is largely influenced by C++. Unlike C++, which combines the syntax for structured, generic, and object-oriented programming, Java was built almost exclusively as an object-oriented language. All code is written inside classes, and every data item is an object, with the exception of the primitive data types, (i.e. integers, floating-point numbers, boolean values, and characters), which are not objects for performance reasons. Java reuses some popular aspects of C++ (such as the printf method).
						Unlike C++, Java does not support operator overloading or multiple inheritance for classes, though multiple inheritance is supported for interfaces.
						Java uses comments similar to those of C++. There are three different styles of comments: a single line style marked with two slashes (//), a multiple line style opened with /* and closed with */, and the Javadoc commenting style opened with /** and closed with */. The Javadoc style of commenting allows the user to run the Javadoc executable to create documentation for the program and can be read by some integrated development environments (IDEs) such as Eclipse to allow developers to access documentation within the IDE.

						<p style="margin-top: 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.7;">Kotlin relaxes Java's restriction of allowing Static Methods and variables inside of only a class body. Instead, Kotlin allows definition of static Objects and Functions at the top-level of the Package body without needing a redundant class level; similar to languages such as C or Pascal. For backwards compatibility with Java, Kotlin adds a special attribute to a Kotlin package body that specifies a Java class name for nesting toplevel static functions and variables when the Kotlin package is viewed from a Java project. (ie. @file:JvmName("JavaClassName")).
